### 🤔 What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces — especially dynamic, interactive web apps. Instead of traditional HTML + JS, React uses reusable components and smart rendering.

### ⚡ What is Vite?

Vite is a modern alternative to tools like Create React App. It starts super fast, has live reload, and makes your dev experience smooth.
